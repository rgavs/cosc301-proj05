TODO:
Cycle through all files in all directories
    Follow all cluster chains
        ensure all clusters are marked free or are referenced in a cluster chain
            and are not marked BAD
                what to do here
        add up size in bytes (adding the likely partially filled cluster EOF)
        compare each of those to size shown in direntry
            size may be > or < ; both are problems
                if > : free clusters over length denoted in metadata
    Upon finding any issues- print out files with inconsistent metadata/actual size


Broad issues:
    Need to think about/decide plans for implementation
        how many helper functions to create etc ???
